The Brier score of 0.17 indicates that, on average, the forecasts were fairly close to the actual outcomes. While there is always room for improvement, especially on days with unexpected weather patterns, the forecaster's predictions can be considered reliable for practical purposes."

The forecaster's predictions for rain were reasonably accurate, as evidenced by the Brier score of 0.17. This score suggests that the forecasts provided valuable information for decision-making regarding weather-related activities."
