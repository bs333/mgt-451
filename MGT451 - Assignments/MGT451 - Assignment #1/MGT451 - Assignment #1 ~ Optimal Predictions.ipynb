    "2. Think of a new everyday phenomenon not included in the original study. Use a domain for which empirical evidence about the event's duration exists, and find that data. Pick something you find fun and interesting.\n",

    "4. Create two plots, following the style of Fig. 2 in the paper. The upper plot should show the empirical distribution of durations you found in Step 2. The lower plot should show both the empirical data you collected in Step 3, as well as the predicted predictions given by the delta t argument.\n",
