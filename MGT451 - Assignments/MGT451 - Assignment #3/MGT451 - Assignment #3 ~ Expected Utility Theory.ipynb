    "Expected Utility Theory (EUT) serves as a foundational framework for decision-making under uncertainty. At its core, EUT posits that individuals act rationally by maximizing expected utility, a measure of their subjective satisfaction tied to various possible outcomes. However, the real-world application of EUT reveals an array of limitations and anomalies that challenge its fundamental assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "One striking anomaly is the phenomenon of risk aversion. While EUT assumes individuals are risk-neutral, meaning they solely base decisions on expected values, empirical observations often unveil risk-averse behavior. In practice, many individuals tend to favor certain outcomes over uncertain ones, even when the latter presents an equivalent expected value. This inclination to prioritize certainty over risk directly contradicts the theory's risk-neutrality assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, risk-seeking behavior introduces yet another paradoxical dimension. Some individuals exhibit a propensity for embracing risk when presented with options of equivalent expected values. In these cases, they willingly opt for uncertain outcomes with the allure of potentially higher rewards, defying EUT's predictions of risk aversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Allais Paradox embodies a classic violation of EUT. It comprises scenarios where individuals make inconsistent choices, highlighting that their preferences do not align with the principles of expected utility maximization. These paradoxes reveal the complex and sometimes irrational nature of human decision-making, challenging EUT's tenets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Framing effects serve as a poignant reminder that context matters. How information is presented significantly impacts choices. Individuals may opt for different decisions when presented with the same information in distinct ways, diverging from the theory's expectation of choice independence from framing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, while Expected Utility Theory lays a theoretical foundation for rational decision-making, the multifaceted realities of human behavior consistently challenge its predictions. These effects and violations reveal the intricacies of decision-making under uncertainty, prompting the development of alternative models that better capture the nuances of human choice."
