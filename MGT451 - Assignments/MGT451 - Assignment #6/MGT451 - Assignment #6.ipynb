This scenario often leads to various driving behaviors, interactions, and choices among drivers."

    "Modeling the complex behavioral phenomenon of traffic merge behavior on highways requires a thorough consideration of the observed behaviors, dependent variables, and influential factors. An agent-based simulation can serve as a valuable tool for gaining insights into the decision-making processes of drivers during merges, ultimately contributing to more efficient and safer road systems."
