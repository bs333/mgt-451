Ask yourself or your friend the question, \"How much (or many) would I need to give you at time t for you to be indifferent between that option versus getting RSooner right now?\".  The answer will be some quantity or value in the same units as RSooner. The ratio gives the discount factor –— i.e., what fraction of the current value is the future value.\n",
