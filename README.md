## MGT451 - Computational Models of Thought and Behavior 

The following repository holds all the code, assignments, and notes for the course MGT451 - Computational Models of Thought and Behavior.

### Course Description

In this course, we review computational models of thought and behavior from across the behavioral and social sciences, including economics, psychology, evolutionary biology, network science, information systems, and sociology. 

The course begins by studying individual thought and behavior, from predicting the future to taking risks. The course proceeds to study group thought and behavior, from social influence to the design of voting mechanisms. Each class covers a new topic in the study of thought and behavior and introduces the range of empirical and theoretical computational approaches to studying that topic.

### Student Learning Outcomes

The course aims to provide students with broad exposure to computational modeling in the behavioral and social sciences. Having taken the course, students will have a toolbox of data structures and algorithms that they can use when reasoning about the thought and behaviors of individuals and groups.

After successful completion of this course:
- Students will be able to model a broad range of thoughts and behaviors.
- Students will be able to model both individuals and groups.
- Students will have an integrated view of the behavioral and social sciences.
- Students will be certified in and capable of replicating behavioral and social-science experiments.
