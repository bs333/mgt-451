## MGT451 - Computational Models of Thought and Behavior 

The following repository holds all the code, assignments, and notes for the course MGT451 - Computational Models of Thought and Behavior.

### Course Description

This course is designed for Master's and Ph.D. graduate students as well as advanced undergraduates. The purpose is to learn applied statistical methodologies pertaining to time series (i.e., a discrete series of observations related to time).

In this course, the students will learn how to estimate financial data models and predict using time series models. The course will cover linear time series (ARIMA) models, conditional heteroscedastic models (ARCH type models), non-linear models (TAR, STAR, MSA), non-parametric models (kernel regression, local regression, neural networks), nonparametric methods of evaluating fit such as bootstrap, parametric bootstrap, and cross-validation. The course will also introduce multivariate time series models such as VAR.

Please refer for the Syllabus for further information.
