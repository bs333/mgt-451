## MGT451 - Computational Models of Thought and Behavior 

The following repository holds all the code, assignments, and notes for the course MGT451 - Computational Models of Thought and Behavior.

### Course Description

In this course, we review computational models of thought and behavior from across the behavioral and social sciences, including economics, psychology, evolutionary biology, network science, information systems, and sociology. 

The course begins by studying individual thought and behavior, from predicting the future to taking risks. The course proceeds to study group thought and behavior, from social influence to the design of voting mechanisms. Each class covers a new topic in the study of thought and behavior and introduces the range of empirical and theoretical computational approaches to studying that topic.
